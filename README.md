ButtonSoup is a lightweight tool for making color themes.
It's based on a single CSS file with a relative color system and lets you quickly create a thin color palette out of a single color value.
I originally built it for myself, when finding most of the theme-builder at hand too distracting.
The style.css file can be taken as is and used in any project.
Enjoy!
